        <h3>one of my favorite french pastries; it has cream, sugar, and so, so much butter. def a lot of calories, but i love making and eating them enough to make up hahaha</h3>

        <h3>plus, though they look really complex, they actually are pretty easy! it takes a lot of work, but it's not difficult work (like macarons cough)</h3>
